# Protocol Buffers â€“ iOS Client App

This app is designed to work with either the [Vapor Server](https://github.com/JoshuaSullivan/Protobufs.vapor-backend) or the [Perfect Server](https://github.com/JoshuaSullivan/Protobufs.perfect-backend). It allows text input which is then sent to the server for reversal.
